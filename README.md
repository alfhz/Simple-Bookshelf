# Bookshelf App

Hey there! Welcome to the **Bookshelf App**, a personal project I created to showcase a simple yet functional web app for managing book collection. Whether youâ€™re an avid reader or just like to keep track of your favorite books, this app has got you covered!

## Whatâ€™s the Bookshelf App About?

The Bookshelf App is designed to help users:
- Add new books to their collection.
- Edit book details like title, author, and release year.
- Change the reading status of a book (e.g., "Not Finished" to "Finished" and vice versa).
- Remove books from the collection.

The app is built with simplicity and functionality in mind, making it easy to manage your bookshelf digitally!

## Key Features

1. **Add Books**: Quickly add new books with essential details like title, author, year, and status.
2. **Edit Details**: Update any bookâ€™s information with ease.
3. **Change Status**: Toggle between "Finished" and "Not Finished" to keep your reading progress organized.
4. **Delete Books**: Remove unwanted books from your collection.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Open the project folder and start working on it.
3. Make sure to follow the structure above when adding new features or updating existing ones.

## Why This App?

This app was initially inspired by my desire to learn and apply front-end web development principles. It's also a fun way to explore how to:
- Structure HTML elements for usability and accessibility.
- Use JavaScript to dynamically manage and update content.
- Create a simple, interactive, and user-friendly interface.
